## Goal for first milestone

We want to start off by getting a feel for manipulating the data and then applying a simple model on it to see if we can get any sort of result. We are using a dataset of Jeopardy quesions from Huggingface to start off, although in the future, we plan to scrape our own dataset, since on the website J Archive there is listed over 500,000 Jeopardy questions, while the Huggingface dataset has less than 300,000 entries.
